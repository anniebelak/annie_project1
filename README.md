The Tic Tac Toe project was my first time coding an application. There were a lot of struggles with gettng started
and know what the correct approach was throughout the process I learned a lot and a lot of the concepts
taught in class began to make sense.

The project plan that I developed,  started with wire frames, users stories, pseudocode.
The wire frames, helped me to visualize how the application would look and how a user might
interact with the game.

Using pseudocode, helped me to define the steps that I needed to solve each step of the requirements,
and gave me a starting point when thinking about how each peice of code should work.

User stories also helped me to undertsand what the problems were that I needed to solve and how the user
wouold want to interact with the application.

User Stories:
As a user I need to be able to sign and out of the game .
As a user I want to know when I lose or win a game.
As a user I want to be able to sign up to the Game URL_PATH.
As a user I want to be able to know how many games I have played.
As a user I would like to play multiple games when signed in.

The biggest struggle for me durring this process was creatng the functions for the Game. I struggled with how to format the
functions and became overwhelmed with how to make them work.
Breaking each step down to small steps became a stratgey that helped me to better be able to figure out each step that needed
to be taken to solve the larger problems, and although I still struggles with some of the concepts I became better at
debugging issues as they came up, and became more confident in what I was doing.

For future iterations of the project I would focus on cleaning up the front end making it look more
appealing to the user. I focused my time on making sure that the game functioned according to the requirements and did not
get as much time as I wanted to make the front end more appealing to the users.
